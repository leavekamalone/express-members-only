# express-members-only
Members Only Message Board written in Express(node)

A very basic forum type of project, creating an authentication system. In the authentication system, the password was secured in the database with Bcrypt.  

The database used throughout this project was MongoDB.  

Used dotenv npm package to secure the database name and password.  

On the client-side, used PUG/Jade as the templating engine to show off the abilities of the message board.  

The authentication system only allows certain members that have access to that password to see who posted.  This was done with passportJs.
